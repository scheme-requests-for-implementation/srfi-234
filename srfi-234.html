<p>This SRFI has complex authorship.  The original specification and
corresponding implementation were written by Shiro Kawai for Gauche.
This SRFI was written by John Cowan, but its design is based on the
Gauche specification.  The implementation was written principally by
Arvydas Silanskas based on the Gauche implementation, and then
modified further by John Cowan to match this SRFI.  Arne
Babenhauserheide took over authorship in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Topological sorting is an algorithm that takes a graph consisting of
nodes and other nodes that depend on them, forming a partial order,
and returns a list representing a total ordering of the graph. If the
graph is cyclic, the topological sort will fail. With the
procedure <code>topological-sort</code>, failure results in
returning <code>#false</code> and additional information is provided
via multiple values. With <code>topological-sort/exception</code>, an
error will be signalled on failure. This SRFI includes utilities to
operate on simple edgelists.

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>Consider the following graph representing steps to be performed:</p>

<img src="Directed_acyclic_graph_2.svg" alt="example graph described below">

<p>This graph means that (among other things) steps 5 and 7 must be
performed before step 11, and step 11 must be performed before steps 2, 9,
and 10.  By topologically sorting this graph, we get one possible total
ordering of the steps that satisfies the partial order.</p>

<p>The graph structure uses an efficient representation for graphs
where a small number of dependencies lead to many dependents.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p><code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph =</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Topologically sorts <em>graph</em>,
which is a list of connections.  Each connection is a list of the form
<code>(</code><em>node dependent dependent</em> ...<code>)</code>,
meaning that <em>dependents</em> are dependent on <em>node</em>.
The optional argument <em>=</em> specifies the identity relation
between nodes; it defaults to <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p>Returns the list of topologically sorted nodes or <code>#f</code>
if the graph cannot be sorted topologically.</p>

<p>If <em>graph</em> is circular, <code>topological-sort</code> may
return <code>values</code> where the second value is an error message
and the third value provides information about at least one cycle. If
a second and third value are provided outside error conditions, they
must both be <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p>It is an error if the same node (in the sense of <em>=</em>) appears
at the head  of more than one connection.<p>

<p>The graph shown above can be represented as
<code>((5 11) (7 11 8) (3 8 10) (11 2 9 10) (8 9))</code>.
One possible result of applying `topological-sort` to this graph
is the list <code>(3 7 5 11 2 8 10 9)</code>, meaning that
performing steps 3, 7, 5, ..., 10, 9 in that order will satisfy
the partial ordering of the graph.</p>

<p><code>(topological-sort/exception </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(topological-sort/exception </code><em>graph =</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the sorted nodes from <code>topologica-sort</code> when
there are no cycles, but if <em>graph</em> is circular, an error
satisfying
<code>circular-graph?</code> is signaled.</p>

<p><code>(circular-graph? </code><em>exception</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if the exception raised
by <code>topological-sort/exception</code> signals a circular graph.</p>

<p><code>(circular-graph-message </code><em>exception</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the message of an exception
matching <code>circular-graph?</code>.</p>

<p><code>(circular-graph-cycle </code><em>exception</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns one circular structure from an exception
matching <code>circular-graph?</code>. The <em>graph</em> may contain
additional cycles.</p>

<p><code>(edgelist-&gt;graph </code><em>edgelist</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(edgelist-&gt;graph </code><em>edgelist =</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Convert an edgelist <code>'((a b) (a c) (b e))</code> to a
graph <code>'((a b c) (b e))</code>. The optional argument <em>=</em>
specifies the identity relation between nodes; it defaults
to <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p><code>(edgelist/inverted-&gt;graph </code><em>edgelist</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(edgelist/inverted-&gt;graph </code><em>edgelist =</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Convert an edgelist <code>'((b a) (c a) (e b))</code> to the
inverted graph <code>'((a b c) (b e))</code>. The optional
argument <em>=</em> specifies the identity relation between nodes; it
defaults to <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p><code>(graph-&gt;edgelist </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Convert a graph <code>'((a b c) (b e))</code> to an edgelist <code>'((a b) (a c) (b e))</code></p>

<p><code>(graph-&gt;edgelist/inverted </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Convert a graph <code>'((a b c) (b e))</code> to an inverted edgelist <code>'((b a) (c a) (e b))</code></p>

<p><code>(connected-components </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Calculate the connected components from a graph of in-neighbors. Returns a list where each item corresponds to one connected component and contains the nodes which form that component.</p>
