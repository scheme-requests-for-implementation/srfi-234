<p class="todo">Revise authorship.  Arvydas says that the sample
  implementation is no longer his.</p>

<p>This SRFI has complex authorship.  The original specification and
corresponding implementation were written by Shiro Kawai for Gauche.
This SRFI was written by John Cowan, but its design is based on the
Gauche specification.  The implementation was written principally by
Arvydas Silanskas based on the Gauche implementation, and then modified
further by John Cowan to match this SRFI.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Topological sorting is an algorithm that takes a graph consisting of
nodes and other nodes that depend on them, forming a partial order,
and returns a list representing a total ordering of the graph.
If the graph is cyclic, the topological sort will fail, and an
error will be signaled.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>Consider the following graph representing steps to be performed:</p>

<img src="Directed_acyclic_graph_2.svg" alt="example graph described below">

<p>This graph means that (among other things) steps 5 and 7 must be
performed before step 11, and step 11 must be performed before steps 2, 9,
and 10.  By topologically sorting this graph, we get one possible total
ordering of the steps that satisfies the partial order.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p><code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph =</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Topologically sorts <em>graph</em>,
which is a list of connections.  Each connection is a list of the form
<code>(</code><em>node dependency dependency</em> ...<code>)</code>,
meaning that <em>dependencies</em> are dependent on <em>node</em>.
The optional argument <em>=</em> specifies the identity relation
between nodes; it defaults to <code>eqv?</code>.</p>
<p>It is an error if the same node (in the sense of <em>=</em>) appears
in more than one connection.<p>
<p>If <em>graph</em> is circular, an error satisfying
<code>circular-graph?</code> is signaled.</p>
<p>The graph shown above can be represented as
<code>((5 11) (7 11 8) (3 8 10) (11 2 9 10) (8 9))</code>.
One possible result of applying `topological-sort` to this graph
is the list <code>(3 7 5 11 2 8 10 9)</code>, meaning that
performing steps 3, 7, 5, ..., 10, 9 in that order will satisfy
the partial ordering of the graph.</p>
